# 🧠 EDA, Preprocessing & Personality Classification 📊🧬

Welcome to the **Kaggle Playground Series - 2025**!  
This repository demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow — from **EDA** to **Model Evaluation** — applied to a fun classification task: **Predicting Personality Types (Introvert vs. Extrovert)** based on behavioral and psychological traits.

---

## 📘 Dataset Overview

🧩 **Goal:** Predict whether a person is an **Introvert** or **Extrovert** based on personality and social behavior traits.  
🧠 The dataset was synthetically generated using a deep learning model trained on the **Extrovert vs. Introvert Behavior** dataset.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> - The dataset is **relatively small**, ideal for quick prototyping, testing models, and creating visualizations.  
> - You may use the **original dataset** to enhance insights or model accuracy.
